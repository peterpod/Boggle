My Project, Boggle, is a user-friendly simple game where
players load 4x4 boggle boards and are prompted to find words and get 
a high Score. The game was created for our 15-112 Fundamentals of 
Computer Science Python based course.

To run my program you need to install python 2.7 and also
a shell to run you program. Within your shell simply run the
program. It will buffer for several seconds before a canvas 
displays then you may play. All the other txt files and images
are provided for you in the folder.

To play the game. Run this file in a command console as you
would any other python file. Python playboggle.py

If you are unsure how to play Boggle feel free to click on the
instructions page which should explain all the basic features
of the game.
