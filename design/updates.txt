Updates-Peter Podniesinski

Basically since the first deliverable I
have made the following changes

1.Changed the user interface so that users can
type the words and enter them upon using the
return key rather than being prompted in the console

Furthermore, this change was seriously key for my
program because prompting briefly pauses programs
until the user answers the prompt. Thus You could not
work with my canvas since it "Did not respond"
2.Users can also use a very interesting feature
where they can click the board to create words.
The board tiles they click turn green when done 
making for a much more engaging game.
3.My program now has a displayed time and score
4.There is a gameOver Feature
five. I have added 4 buttons of which 2 are functional.
	The buttons so far only pause and start the game.
